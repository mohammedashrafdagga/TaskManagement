- Task assignment: Allow users to assign tasks to other users or a team.

- Task status updates: Allow users to update the status of a task (e.g., in progress, completed, postponed).

- Task filtering and sorting: Allow users to filter and sort tasks based on different criteria (e.g., due date, priority, status, assignee).

- Notifications: Send email notifications to users when a task is assigned to them or when a task deadline is approaching.

- Comments: Allow users to add comments to tasks to provide additional context or information.

- Reporting: Provide users with reports and analytics about their tasks, such as completed tasks, overdue tasks, and task distribution by user or team.
